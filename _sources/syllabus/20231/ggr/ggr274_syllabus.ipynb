    "## Course description \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science is a collection of disciplines with a shared mission of using digital technologies and information to advance human society.  Social scientists are increasingly working with big and complex datasets to answer questions about society. The purpose of this course is to give you a broad introduction to the many of the ways social scientists learn about society using data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to statistical reasoning, learning from data involves computation and communication. We will use the Python programming language and environment for statistical computing, and tutorials will introduce students to communicating statistical knowledge. In addition to computer programming, learning from data involves statistical reasoning and communication.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Course learning objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write computer programs in Python to prepare data for statistical analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write computer programs in Python to conduct a variety of statistical analyses using Python and provide an oral and written interpretation of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify appropriate uses of computational and statistical methods to answer social science questions, including their strengths and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clearly communicate the results of a data analysis to both technical and non-technical audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall purpose of the tutorials is for you to gain experience using Python in a Jupyter notebook to compute and visualize data under the guidance of a teaching assisstant.\n",
    "During most tutorials you will be given a small assessment that will usually involve using Python to complete by the end of the tutorial.\n",
    "Tutorials are not optional and you may be asked to prepare for tutorials, although TAs will not be taking attendance, but you will typically be required to submit an assessment at the end of each tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tentative weekly schedule \n",

    "*Note*: the final exam will be scheduled by the Faculty of Arts & Science (FAS).\n",
    "For more information, check the [FAS Exams & Assessments webpage](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/faculty-registrar/exams-assessments).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weekly lab and homework \n",
    "\n",
    "Each week except for the weeks of the midterm test and last week of classes there will be a computational lab that you will submit by the end of your tutorial, and homework that you will submit Thursday by 23:59.  There will be ten weekly labs (the PRA ) and homework assignments. Your grade will be calculated by dropping your two lowest scores for each of the lab and homework assessments.  Submission details will follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Midterm test \n",
    "\n",
    "The midterm test format will be either in person or online. The format will be communicated closer to the test date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final project \n",
    "\n",
    "The final project will involve students using data science methodologies to explore a social science question, and communicate the results.  A draft proposal of your plan will be due on March 20 at 23:59 and the final project will be due on April 10.  One of the goals of the draft proposal is to give you feedback that can be incorporated into your final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final exam/assessment \n",
    "\n",
    "The final exam format will be either in person and scheduled by the Faculty of Arts and Science or an online final assessment. The format will be communicated closer to the test date. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Important note about tutorials \n",
    "\n",
    "Your tutorial grade includes any assigned work that is due before tutorial and any work done during tutorial. Note that if you miss a tutorial, there is no way to make up this component of your mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missed assessments \n",
    "\n",
    "### Weekly lab and homework \n",
    "\n",
    "Late lab or weekly homework assignments will not be accepted for any reason, since we plan to post answers soon after the due date.  If you do not submit a lab or homework by the deadline then your grade on will be 0.  NB: the two lowest lab and homework will be excluded when calculating your final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Midterm test \n",
    "\n",
    "If you miss the midterm for any reason then you will have an opportunity to write a makeup midterm sometime during the same week (i.e., before February 18). If you miss both the scheduled midterm and the makeup midterm then you will receive a 0 for the midterm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final exam/assessment \n",
    "\n",
    "If the final exam is in person and scheduled by the faculty and you miss the final exam then you should contact your college registrar.  If the final assessment is scheduled by the teaching team and you miss this assessment for any reason then you will be given one opportunity to complete a makeup assessment scheduled during the final assessment period. If you do not complete the final assessment then your grade for the final assessment will be 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no need to install any software on your own computer.  All the software for the course can be accessed via any computer with a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.).  We will be using the [University of Toronto JupyterHub](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca) for computing.  In this course, most of the data science computational work will be done using the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org) in a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org). You will explore these tools during the labs and homeworks and use them to produce your final project. We're here to help, so ask when you're stuck!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to install Python and Jupyter on your own computer. But, if you decide to use it to complete course assessments, and **you encounter problems using Python and Jupyter to complete a course assessment on your own computer, then we will not be able to provide support**.  In particular, this will not be a valid excuse that your assignment was submitted after its due date.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking Concerns \n",
    "\n",
    "Any requests to have an assessment remarked must contain a written justification for consideration. Marking requests should be made within one week of receiving your assessment. *Please note* that we reserve the right to reconsider the marking of every question on your assessment when you resubmit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to communicate with your instructors \n",
    "\n",
    "Questions about course material or organization, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do I change the colour of my plotting symbol?\n",
    "- What is question 3 asking us to do?\n",
    "- When is the term test?\n",
    "\n",
    "should be posted on the discussion forums or asked in person. Questions can be posted anonymously (so that the author is anonymous to other students but not to the instructors), if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your communication is private, such as \"I missed the test because I was ill\", then email your instructor. If you missed a tutorial, email your TA. Use your utoronto.ca email account to ensure that your message doesn’t automatically go to a Junk folder and please include your full name, UTORid, and student number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Academic Integrity \n",
    "\n",
    "You are responsible for knowing the content of the [University of Toronto’s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, we encourage you to discuss course material with each other and ask others for advice. However, it is not permitted to share complete solutions or to directly share code for anything that is to be handed in. When an assignment is required to be completed as a team, you may share solutions and code with other members of your team, but not with another team in the class. For example, “For question 2 what Python function did you use?” is a fair question; “Please show me your Python code for question 2” is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions about what is or is not permitted in this course, please do not hesitate to contact your instructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessibility Needs \n",
    "\n",
    "The University of Toronto is committed to accessibility. If you require accommodations for a disability, or have any accessibility concerns about the course, the class room, or course materials, please contact Accessibility Services as soon as possible: <accessibility.services@utoronto.ca> or http://accessibility.utoronto.ca\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Responsibilities \n",
    "\n",
    "The course is designed to actively engage you in the course material. We hope you’ll find this course on social science, computation and data science interesting, challenging, and fun. In order for classroom sessions and tutorials to be effective, prepare by learning about the weeks concepts through completing the recommended problems and readings."
